; atomese-kernel.scm
;
; Basic OpenCL GPU vector multiplication demo.
;
; Uses the Atomese "sensory" style API to open a channel to the
; OpenCL processing unit, and then send kernels and data there.
;
; Before running the demo, copy `vec-kernel.cl` in this directory to
; the `/tmp` directory; alternately, change the URL below.
;
; To run the demo, say `guile -s atomese-kernel.scm`. Alternately,
; cut-n-paste from this file to a guile command line.
;
; The demo has four parts:
; * Creating and opening a channel to the OpenCL device.
; * Sending a kernel along with NumberNode vector data the device.
; * Sending FloatValue data. Unlike NumberNodes, FloatValues are NOT
;   stored in the AtomSpace. This means they don't take up storage
;   space. This also means they are a bit harder to use, since they're
;   ephemeral, and disappear if not attached to an anchor point.

; URL specifying platform, device and program source.
; Modify as needed. Any substrings will do for platform and device,
; including empty strings. The first match found will be used.
; If in doubt, try 'opencl://:/tmp/vec-kernel.cl`
;
; Must be of the form 'opencl://platform/device/path/to/kernel.cl'
; Can also be clcpp or spv file.

; that we want to receive. Two choices are avalabile: NumberNode
; and FloatValue.
(cog-execute!
	(SetValue clnode (Predicate "*-open-*") (Type 'FloatValue)))

; ---------------------------------------------------------------
; Now that it's open, define a simple stream that will write the name
; of a kernel and some vector data to the GPU/machine. This just defines
; what to do; nothing is done until this is executed.

; CAUTION: Do not try to get the result twice! The second call will
; hang. This is intentional, and designed for multi-threaded async
; operation: the *-read-* waits for the earlier *-write-* to complete.
; If you do this in multiple threads, it all works correctly, with the
; reader waiting for the writer to finish. However, for this single-
; threaed demo, a second read will just hang, and you'll be sorry.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------

; After the OpenclNode is opened, a list of kernel interfaces
; provided by the OpenCL program there is published. It can be
; viewed as follows:

(cog-value clnode (Predicate "*-description-*"))

; This interface description is used to check the validity of
; kernel arguments used above. It is provided to enable the
; introspection of the OpenCl program kernel API by Atomese
; agents.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------
; Instead of using NumberNodes, use FloatValues.
; Both types can hold vectors of floats. NumberNodes are stored in
; the AtomSpace (and thus clog things up), while FloatValues are not.
; Which is great, as usually there are lots of them.
; The trade-off is that the Values have to be put somewhere where they
; can be found. i.e. anchored "some where".
